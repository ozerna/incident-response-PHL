Hello,

We will go right to the point. We are in possession of your database files, which include sensitive information about your customers.

You wouldn't want this information to be out on the internet, would you? We will release this information on https://pastebin.com if you don &#39;t deposit 10 BTC to the following wallet ID: 

1JQqFLmAp5DQJbdD3ThgEiJGSmX8eaaBid 

by Monday at 10:00AM UTC.  

To demonstrate to you that we aren &#39;t just playing games, here is a snippet of your customer database table:

+------------------+-----------------+--------------+
| contactFirstName | contactLastName | phone        |
+------------------+-----------------+--------------+
| Carine           | Schmitt         | 40.32.2555   |
| Jean             | King            | 7025551838   |
| Peter            | Ferguson        | 03 9520 4555 |
| Janine           | Labrune         | 40.67.8555   |
| Jonas            | Bergulfsen      | 07-98 9555   |
+------------------+-----------------+--------------+

Now the ball is in your court to make the right decision and take action. There will be no negotiations on the price.

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the TOR browser installer: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. Install it silently: ```tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.5.exe /S```
3. Opens the TOR browser from the folder on the desktop
4. Connect to TOR and browse a few sites. For example:
   - Current Dread Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion```
   - Dark Markets Forum: ```g66ol3eb5ujdckzqqfmjsbpdjufmjd5nsgdipvxmsh7rckzlhywlzlqd.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets```
   - Current Elysium Market: ```elysiumyeudtha62s4oaowwm7ifmnunz3khs4sllhvinphfm4nirfcqd.onion```
6. Create a folder on your desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` and put a few fake (illicit) items in there
7. Delete the file.
